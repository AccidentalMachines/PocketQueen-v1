# Pocket Queen 1.0

**Pocket Queen** is a modern 3D-printed metronome for drummers, featuring both audible and visual tempo cues. It’s designed to sit on a table or mount anywhere on a drum kit using a standard 1/4-20 clamp.

## ⚠️ WARNING — Work in Progress
Pocket Queen v1.0 is still a work in progress.  
The current hardware design **does not include an onboard charging circuit** for the lithium-ion battery.  
To recharge the battery, the unit must be **disassembled and the battery removed** for charging with an **Adafruit Micro-Lipo Charger for LiPoly batteries (USB Type-C)**.  

> Note: The Micro-USB port on the Pocket Queen does **not** recharge the battery — it only provides USB data/power to the Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit board.  
> This critical design limitation will be **addressed in the next hardware revision.**
